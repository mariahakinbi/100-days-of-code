# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** It took forever and a half (3+ hours) to get a domain name and figure out how to set up hosting on GitHub with the forked repo. Although I've used Git/GitHub many times I'm still annoyingly cautious about everything.. Given how long everything took today, I may have to adjust the timeline (:

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays the original repo's ReadMe)
**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get mariahakinbi.com to show the landing page - either by making a new index.html that immediately refreshes to the index.html file in the subfolder or by moving all of the folders from the subfolder to the main repo directory. (2) change out the resumes (3) figure out if I need to download bootstrap, etc. (4) edit the content!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
