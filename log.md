# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: June 27, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Home and About pages are officially DONE!!!

**Thoughts:** Discovered that Font Awesome is actually AWESOME! The open source community never ceases to amaze me. Also ditching the nav bar within a nav bar idea..too much for a portfolio landing page. Changed how much of the picture is shown by cropping outside of my editor (in Mac's Preview), but still trying to find out how to do this with code

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (The Home and About pages are done!)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) change colors on rec carousel (2) change What I Love to Do page (3) make the nav bar slowly appear while one is scrolling down (?)

**Lingering Questions:** Not a question but need more info on what determines what is displayed in a "section"?..why isn't the entire section shown all at once?? padding? margins? height?

### Day 2: June 26, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Changed the background image, rotator speed, nav bar, and social media accounts

**Thoughts:** Accomplished everything on the to-do list! Not sure why some of the meta tags in the header are there..actually just figured it out after I typed that and just changed them. 

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (The home page is *almost* officially customized!)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get twitter icon button (2) delete "home" in nav bar (3) make the about it's own nav bar? nav bar within a nav bar?? ..Now that I think of it, I know that's possible

**Lingering Questions:** How do you specify what part of the picture becomes the background image? (responsive cropping)


### Day 1: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: mariahakinbi.com shows the landing page!!

**Thoughts:** Just over one hour today! Making progress! Did the first three things on yesterday's to-do list. To get the domain to show the landing page I had to move the contents from the subfolder to the main repo directory and then deleted the subfolder. I'd still like to figure out what the url would be to link an index.html file to a subfolder's index.html file. Right before I did the subfolder switch, mariahakinbi.com was redirecting to the index.html file on GitHub, rather than <i> showing </i> the file as a webpage. Not concerned with downloading boostrap right now.

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays paul's info+portfolio)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) make the home page scroll slower (2) change nav bar (3) change background image on home page

**Today's Progress**: Got a domain name and set up hosting on GitHub!

**Thoughts:** It took forever and a half (3+ hours) to get a domain name and figure out how to set up hosting on GitHub with the forked repo. Although I've used Git/GitHub many times I'm still annoyingly cautious about everything.. Given how long everything took today, I may have to adjust the timeline (:

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays the original repo's ReadMe)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get mariahakinbi.com to show the landing page - either by making a new index.html that immediately refreshes to the index.html file in the subfolder or by moving all of the folders from the subfolder to the main repo directory. (2) change out the resumes (3) figure out if I need to download bootstrap, etc. (4) edit the content!
