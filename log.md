#####

**Today's Progress**: Updated pdfs on portfolio page + figured out that I need to figure out how to get this affixed navbar to fade in. Have a few videos to watch tomorrow and some documentation to read. Spent time doing Udemy's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course - went through the Matplotlib section.

### Day 8: July 2, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: WEBKIT EASE TRANSITION FTW!!!!!!!

**Thoughts:** Today was another DayOfCode where I was about to close out of everything and but just wanted to give it one last try and it worked!! (kinda) I used webkit ease transition instead of trying to do a jquery fade in. I'd still like to figure out the jquery becuase that is more the look I'm going for, but the ease transiton will do for now!

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) responsiveness of homepage (2) make nav bar slowly appear on About page

### Day 8: July 2, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Initially wanted a day off, but glad I got down to it. Worked on making the navbar fade in - still can't figure out why it just appears on the about page

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) responsiveness of homepage (2) make nav bar slowly appear on About page

### Day 7: July 1, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the StudentU logo, though it still doesn't have a transparent backgroud. Portfolio is pretty much done. Spent a lot of time on the preloader. Just want to make nav bar slowly appear and tweak the responsiveness of the homepage.

**Thoughts:** I like that everything is online and available, one just has to find it. It is motivating to know that what I'm trying to do has already been done and is feasible. This pushes me to keep going until I get it right.

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (Done - minor tweaks)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) responsiveness of homepage (2) make nav bar slowly appear on About page


### Day 6: June 30, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Resized the images and figured out how to add text/skills when hovring over a project in the portfolio -- Paul already had the code in the repo, just had to uncomment it! Portfolio page is done. In the future, I'll have to figure out how to get the second row of elemnts in line with each other - sometimes they are crooked. Timeline resume is complete, need to fix the StudentU resume logo

**Thoughts:**

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (Portfolio page is done. StudentU logo needs to be transparent)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) fix StudentU logo (2) SKILLS PAGE!!! (3) animated cog on loading page (3) make the nav bar slowly appear while one is scrolling down (?)


### Day 5: June 29, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**:figured out how to make the backgrounds white! need to resize the images a little more. Everything else on the projects/portfolio page is done

**Thoughts:** Work-life balance is important. Now time to work on other things..

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (portfolio page is *almost* done)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) Resize projects page images (2) hover add text/skills (3) change Resume page (4) make the nav bar slowly appear while one is scrolling down (?)


### Day 5: June 29, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: worked on adding white background to images .. so hour wasn't spent coding..

**Thoughts:** bummed I didn't make more progress, but given that it is my 24/7 resume I don't mind spending the time to make the UI nice

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (one logo + description in the portfolio page is *almost* done)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** same list as yesterday!


### Day 4: June 28, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Home, About, and What I Love to Do are done

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) change Projects/Portfolio page (2) hover add text/skills (3) change Resume page (4) make the nav bar slowly appear while one is scrolling down (?)


### Day 3: June 27, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Home and About pages are officially DONE!!!

**Thoughts:** Discovered that Font Awesome is actually AWESOME! The open source community never ceases to amaze me. Also ditching the nav bar within a nav bar idea..too much for a portfolio landing page. Changed how much of the picture is shown by cropping outside of my editor (in Mac's Preview), but still trying to find out how to do this with code

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (The Home and About pages are done!)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) change colors on rec carousel (2) change What I Love to Do page (3) make the nav bar slowly appear while one is scrolling down (?)

**Lingering Questions:** Not a question but need more info on what determines what is displayed in a "section"?..why isn't the entire section shown all at once?? padding? margins? height?

### Day 2: June 26, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Changed the background image, rotator speed, nav bar, and social media accounts

**Thoughts:** Accomplished everything on the to-do list! Not sure why some of the meta tags in the header are there..actually just figured it out after I typed that and just changed them. 

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (The home page is *almost* officially customized!)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get twitter icon button (2) delete "home" in nav bar (3) make the about it's own nav bar? nav bar within a nav bar?? ..Now that I think of it, I know that's possible

**Lingering Questions:** How do you specify what part of the picture becomes the background image? (responsive cropping)


### Day 1: June 25, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: mariahakinbi.com shows the landing page!!

**Thoughts:** Just over one hour today! Making progress! Did the first three things on yesterday's to-do list. To get the domain to show the landing page I had to move the contents from the subfolder to the main repo directory and then deleted the subfolder. I'd still like to figure out what the url would be to link an index.html file to a subfolder's index.html file. Right before I did the subfolder switch, mariahakinbi.com was redirecting to the index.html file on GitHub, rather than <i> showing </i> the file as a webpage. Not concerned with downloading boostrap right now.

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays paul's info+portfolio)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) make the home page scroll slower (2) change nav bar (3) change background image on home page

### Day 0: June 24, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Got a domain name and set up hosting on GitHub!

**Thoughts:** It took forever and a half (3+ hours) to get a domain name and figure out how to set up hosting on GitHub with the forked repo. Although I've used Git/GitHub many times I'm still annoyingly cautious about everything.. Given how long everything took today, I may have to adjust the timeline (:

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays the original repo's ReadMe)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get mariahakinbi.com to show the landing page - either by making a new index.html that immediately refreshes to the index.html file in the subfolder or by moving all of the folders from the subfolder to the main repo directory. (2) change out the resumes (3) figure out if I need to download bootstrap, etc. (4) edit the content!
