**Today's Progress**: mariahakinbi.com shows the landing page!!

**Thoughts:** Just over one hour today! Making progress! Did the first three things on yesterday's to-do list. To get the domain to show the landing page I had to move the contents from the subfolder to the main repo directory and then deleted the subfolder. I'd still like to figure out what the url would be to link an index.html file to a subfolder's index.html file. Right before I did the subfolder switch, mariahakinbi.com was redirecting to the index.html file on GitHub, rather than <i> showing </i> the file as a webpage. Not concerned with downloading boostrap right now.

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays paul's info+portfolio)

**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) make the home page scroll slower (2) change nav bar (3) change background image on home page

**Today's Progress**: Got a domain name and set up hosting on GitHub!

**Thoughts:** It took forever and a half (3+ hours) to get a domain name and figure out how to set up hosting on GitHub with the forked repo. Although I've used Git/GitHub many times I'm still annoyingly cautious about everything.. Given how long everything took today, I may have to adjust the timeline (:

**Link to work:** mariahakinbi.com (currently displays the original repo's ReadMe)
**Tomorrow's To-Do:** (1) get mariahakinbi.com to show the landing page - either by making a new index.html that immediately refreshes to the index.html file in the subfolder or by moving all of the folders from the subfolder to the main repo directory. (2) change out the resumes (3) figure out if I need to download bootstrap, etc. (4) edit the content!
